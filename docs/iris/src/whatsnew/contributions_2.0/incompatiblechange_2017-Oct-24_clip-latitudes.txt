The :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.guess_bounds()` now limits the guessed bounds to [-90, 90] for latitudes by default.


:class:`iris.coords.Cell` objects in time coordinates now contain datetime objects by default and not numbers.
For example::
    >>> cube = iris.load_cube(iris.sample_data_path('air_temp.pp'))
    >>> print(cube.coord('time').cell(0).point)

This change particularly impacts constraining datasets on time. All time constraints
must now be constructed with datetime objects or :class:`~iris.time.PartialDateTime` objects.
See userguide section 2.2.1 for more details on producing time constraints.


            The option `clip_latitudes` controlled whether the
            :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.guess_bounds()` method would limit the
            guessed bounds to [-90, 90] for latitudes.
            
            
            
            +* Deprecated FUTURE flag :attr:`iris.Future.netcdf_promote`.
+
+* Removed deprecated behaviour that does not automatically promote NetCDF variables to cubes.
+  This change means that NetCDF variables that define reference surfaces for dimensionless vertical coordinates
+  will always be promoted and loaded as independent cubes.
